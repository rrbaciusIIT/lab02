    <p>Students completing this course will learn to:</p>
    <ul><li>Recognize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript markup and code.
        <li>Select the proper mark-up tags or code to achieve a particular result.
        <li> Identify improperly used markup and code.
        <li>Produce modern standards compliant web pages.
        <li> Deploy web pages to a GitHub server.
        <li>Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML; error-free, backward- and forward-compatible CSS;

        <li>Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability.
        <li>Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version control.</ul>

    <h2>Course Objectives:</h2>
    <p>At the conclusion of this course, successful students will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain the client and server architecture of the internet and related web technologies.
        <li>Use a basic text editor and other software tools to create web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Foundation.
        <li>Deploy web pages to a Gethub using version control.
        <li>Understand the history and track the ongoing development of web standard specifications from the W3C, ISO, IETF, and other specifications-issuing groups.
        <li>Research and argue for particular methods of web development that keep structure in HTML, design entirely in CSS, and progressively enhanced behavior in JavaScript.
        <li>Engage in agile, iterative web development, supported by version control.
        <li> Write useful, descriptive messages attached to granular commits in a version control.</ul>
